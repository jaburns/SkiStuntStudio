Ski Stunt Studio
======

This is a fully featured level editor for Ski Stunt Simulator.  The editor itself is written in C# and is
capable of exporting/importing custom maps as a single file.  It supports creation of terrain using an 
intuitive, mouse-based, Bezier curve drawing system.

The game's TCL scripts are heavily modified to add an extra level "difficulty" category for custom maps as
well.  This list is managed automatically by the level editor software when you import/create maps.

Check out a video demonstration of the creation of a custom level here:

The game has been released as freeware by the original authors and a valid serial number can be obtained
from the game's [home page](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~van/papers/skistunt.html).
